# Nokia open source

## Our Open Source Commitment

At Nokia we believe in open source software. In the appropriate areas, sharing, cooperating, and working together not
only makes the software better, but brings the best out of innovating together. Nokia has a long history in open source
and we bring a history reaching over 20 years into the community.

More information available in the [Nokia Open Source Pages](https://www.nokia.com/open-source/).

## What is in this organisation?

This GitHub organisation is the default home of the open source projects we create. In addition by default we initate
the pull request to the open source projects we are contributing to in GitHub.
